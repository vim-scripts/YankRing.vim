2. Description                                   *yankring-description*

 Vim already maintains a list of numbered registers containing the last 9
 deletes.  These previous deletes can be referenced using [register]p, so 
 "1p will paste the last delete, "2p the 2nd last delete.  For more
 information see |quote_number|.

 Vim does not provide any mechanism to reference previous yanked text.  
 In Emacs this feature is called the "kill ring".

 The yankring plugin allows the user to configure the number of yanked
 and deleted text.  After text has been pasted, it can be replaced with
 a previous value from the yankring.

 The plugin can be toggled on and off, and supports:
    Ranges
    Registers
    Counts
    All visual modes
 
 If you have any suggestions for the improvement of this plugin, see the
 yankring.vim file for my email address.  Suggestions / bug reports are
 always welcome.

3. Configuration                                 *yankring-configure*

 The yankring allows the user to choose which keys are to be assigned to
 the various commands.  By default, the yankring chose keys identical
 with Vim's standard behaviour/keys.  

3.1 Global Variables                             *yankring-globals*

 You can customize the yankring by setting various global variables in
 your |.vimrc|.
>
    yankring_max_history 
<       Default: 30
        Controls how many elements to save in the yankring. >
            let g:yankring_max_history = 30
    yankring_enabled
<       Default: 1
        If you do not want to yankring enabled by default, set this 
        variable in your |vimrc|. >
            let g:yankring_enabled = 0  " Disables the yankring
    yankring_separator  
<       Default: ,
        Used to parse yankring_n_keys. >
            let g:yankring_separator = ','
    yankring_max_display  
<       Default: 0
        When the YRShow command is issued, it will truncate the elements
        in the yankring to the fit the size of the Vim window, so that
        a single element does not display over multiple lines. >
            let g:yankring_max_display = 70
    yankring_dot_repeat_yank
<       Default: Based on the Vim cpoption setting
        By default Vim will not repeat (using '.') yanking of text.  This can
        be controlled via the |'cpoptions'| setting.  The yankring now respects
        the cpoptions setting, if 'y' is included and you press '.', the
        previous yank command is repeated and added to the yankring.
        You can also add this behaviour by setting this in your |vimrc|: >
            let g:yankring_dot_repeat_yank = 1
    yankring_ignore_duplicate
<       Default: 1
        Duplicates will not be added to the yankring by default.  If a
        duplicate is found, that element will be moved to the top of the
        yankring (using YRSetTop).  This can be controlled by setting this in
        your |vimrc|: >
            let g:yankring_ignore_duplicate = 0 
    yankring_map_dot
<       Default: 1
        If the '.' (repeat) command should be mapped by the yankring.
        Since most of the normal commands yy,dd,dw,... are mapped
        by the yankring, the . operator will not repeat these.
        The yankring tracks several of the internal Vim registers 
        and decides whether an action was the result of the yankring
        or an action outside of it.  If the previous action was a
        result of the yankring, it will be executed again.  If it
        was an action outside of the yankring, it asks Vim to repeat
        the command. >
            let g:yankring_map_dot = 1
<
3.2 Default Keys                                 *yankring-mappings*

 You can choose to override the default keys by creating these global
 variables in your |vimrc|.
>
    yankring_n_keys
<       n - normal mode
        Default: yy,dd,yw,dw,ye,de,yE,dE,yiw,diw,yaw,daw,
                 y$,d$,Y,D,yG,dG,ygg,dgg
        Yanks text in normal mode.    
        Using the yankring_separator, the above list is parsed and 
        individual mappings are created.  For each of the above normal 
        commands the yankring will include the text those commands 
        acted upon.   There are many ways to accomplish the same result 
        in Vim, if you do not see a common key stroke you regularly use
        simply add the following to your |vimrc| with the additional 
        keys you wished mapped.  >
        let g:yankring_n_keys = 'yy,dd,yw,dw,ye,de,yE,dE,yiw,diw,yaw,daw,y$,d$,Y,D,yG,dG,ygg,dgg'
    yankring_v_key
<       v - visual mode
        Default: y 
        Yanks visually select text.   >
    yankring_del_v_key
<       n - normal mode
        Default: d 
        The visually select text is included in the yankring and deleted. >
    yankring_paste_n_bkey
<       n - normal mode
        b - before
        Default: P
        The default Vim paste key will retrieve from the yankring.  This 
        will paste the text BEFORE the current position. 
        There is a special check to see if the text in the default paste
        register is the same as what is in the current position of the 
        yankring.  If it is not, we assume the user used some other 
        mechanism to yank text (ie yt<character>).  If this is the case
        we paste the text in the default paste buffer.  Using <C-P> the
        text can be replaced with the current entry from the yankring.
        Since there are many ways to do things in Vim, this provides
        the best integration. >
    yankring_paste_n_akey
<       n - normal mode
        a - after
        Default: p 
        The default Vim paste key will retrieve from the yankring.  This 
        will paste the text AFTER the current position. 
        There is a special check to see if the text in the default paste
        register is the same as what is in the current position of the 
        yankring.  If it is not, we assume the user used some other 
        mechanism to yank text (ie yt<character>).  If this is the case
        we paste the text in the default paste buffer.  Using <C-P> the
        text can be replaced with the current entry from the yankring.
        Since there are many ways to do things in Vim, this provides
        the best integration. >
    yankring_paste_v_key
<       n - normal mode
        Default: p
        This will replace the visually select text with the contents 
        from the yankring.   See yankring_paste_n_akey for additional
        details.  >
    yankring_replace_n_pkey
<       n - normal mode
        Default: <C-P>
        If you wish to cycle through the yankring, replacing the previously
        pasted text with the previous yanked text you can repeatedly press
        <C-P> (or whatever keystroke you choose to map it to).  This map
        moves backwards through the yankring, so you will retrieve your
        most recent yank.  >
    yankring_replace_n_nkey
<       n - normal mode
        Default: <C-N>
        If you wish to cycle through the yankring, replacing the previously
        pasted text with the previous yanked text you can repeatedly press
        <C-N> (or whatever keystroke you choose to map it to).  This map 
        moves forwards through the yankring, so you will retrieve your 
        oldest yank.  But it is also useful if you press <C-P> too many 
        times, you can cycle in the other direction if you passed the 
        text you wanted.

3.3 Customizing Maps                             *yankring-custom-maps*

 The yankring plugin uses the yankring_n_keys global variable to create 
 a number of defaults maps.  The maps are of the form: >
    nnoremap Y  :<C-U>YRYankCount 'Y'<CR>
<When capital Y is pressed, the yankring will execute 'Y' and capture the
 output from Vim.  But there are cases where you do not want the default
 behaviour of Vim, since you have customized some of these maps.

 In this case, I usually map Y to be |y$|, which makes it consistent with 
 the |D| and |C| operators.  The way yankring_n_keys works does not allow
 me to customize this behaviour.  Since many people may like to customize
 the behaviour of these maps the yankring will check to see if a
 function called YRRunAfterMaps() exists.  If it does, it will call 
 this function after it has created the maps.  So in my case, I created
 the following function in my |vimrc|: >
    function! YRRunAfterMaps()
        nnoremap Y   :<C-U>YRYankCount 'y$'<CR>
    endfunction
<
 You can do anything you need in this function.  >
        nnoremap Y   :<C-U>YRYankCount 'y$'<CR>
<This line remaps Y (which the user presses) to the YRYankCount command.  The
 YRYankCount tells Vim to execute y$ instead.


4 Commands:                                      *yankring-commands*

 The predefined mappings call some specific commands with special parameters.
 If you are going to create additional maps, it is important you mirror
 the same parameters.


4.1  YRToggle                                    *YRToggle*
         Allows you to enable and disable the yankring quickly.  This 
         command will remove the default maps and recreate them.

         Examples: >
            :YRToggle    " Toggles it
            :YRToggle 1  " Enables it
            :YRToggle 0  " Disables it
<            

4.2  YRClear                                     *YRClear*
         Clears all elements from the yankring.
         See also |YRClear-example|.


4.3  YRShow                                      *YRShow*
         Similar to |:register|, will display all the entries in the yankring.
         The element at the top will be the next element pasted from the
         yankring.

         Examples:  >
            :YRShow     " Shows all entries in the yankring
            :YRShow 5   " Shows top 5 entries in the yankring

            --- YankRing ---
            Elem  Content
            5     five^@
            4     four^@
            3     three^@
            2     two^@
            1     one^@
<    

4.4  YRSetTop                                    *YRSetTop*
         Allows you to specify which entry in the yankring should be at
         the top.  This is useful when used with |YRGetMultiple|.

         Examples:  >
            :YRSetTop 3  " Sets element 3 as the next pasted element
<           See also |YRSetTop-example|.
             
     
4.5  YRGetElem                                   *YRGetElem*
        This command has two modes.  If no parameters are provided, it 
        becomes interactive.  It uses YRShow to display the list and 
        allows you to choose which element to paste.  If a parameter
        is supplied it will paste that element from the yankring.  If the
        number specified is outside of the yankring an error is returned.
        You may want to create a separate mapping for this call. >
            nnoremap <silent> <Leader>yr :YRGetElem<CR>
<       See also |YRSearch|.
 
        Examples:
            Assume there are 10 elements in the yankring and element 6 is 
            at the top of the ring. >
            :YRGetElem     " Interactive mode, you choose from a list
            :YRGetElem 4   " Will paste element 4.
            :YRGetElem 12  " Will paste element 6.
            :YRGetElem 99  " Error, invalid choice is reported
            :YRGetElem 0   " Error, invalid choice is reported
<           See also |YRGetElem-example|.
 

4.6  YRGetMultiple                               *YRGetMultiple*
        Will paste many elements from the yankring in one command.
        If the number specified is less than 1, it is assumed you want
        just the current element pasted.  If the number specified is 
        greater than the number of elements in the yankring, it is 
        assumed you want all elements pasted.  See the 
        |yankring-tutorial| for more examples.

        Examples:
            Assume there are 10 elements in the yankring and element 6 is 
            at the top of the ring. >
            :YRGetMultiple 4   " Will paste elements 6,5,4,3
            :YRGetMultiple     " Will paste element  6
            :YRGetMultiple 12  " Will paste elements 6,5,4,3,2,1,10,9,8,7
            :YRGetMultiple 99  " Will paste elements 6,5,4,3,2,1,10,9,8,7
            :YRGetMultiple 0   " Will paste element  6
<           See also |YRGetMultiple-example|.
 

4.7  YRPush                                      *YRPush*
         Allows the user to "push" additional entries into the yankring.
         If you yanked text via a key mapping which does not use the 
         yankring (or there is text on the clipboard) you can use this
         command to add the text to the yankring.

         Examples: >
            :YRPush    " Push the "  register's contents 
            :YRPush *  " Push the *  register's contents (clipboard)
            :YRPush a  " Push the "a register's contents 
<           See also |YRPush-example|.
             

4.8  YRPop                                       *YRPop*
         Allows you to pop off the top elements from the yankring.  You 
         cannot remove elements from within the ring, only the highest 
         elements.  The command optionally takes one parameter to 
         specify how many elements to pop.  The default value is 1, only
         the top most element from the yankring.

         Examples: >
            :YRPop    " Removes the highest numbered element from the 
                        yankring
            :YRPop 5  " Removes the 5 highest numbered elements from the 
                        yankring
<           See also |YRPop-example|.
             

4.9  YRYankCount                                 *YRYankCount*
         This command has the most mappings created for it.  If you are 
         in normal mode and you are not specifying a range, this command
         will add the text to the yankring.

         The goal of this command is to allow the yankring to be integrated
         as seamlessly as possible with Vim.  So it supports counts and 
         registers.  If you create a mapping to it, you must pass as a
         parameter the action you want Vim to perform.  You could do the 
         following: >
            nnoremap \test  :<C-U>YRYankCount 'dd'<CR>
<        This map is executed when you hit the '\test' keystrokes, but
         it will actually delete the current line and add it to the 
         yankring.

         The following are the default mappings: >
            nnoremap yy  :<C-U>YRYankCount 'yy'<CR>
            nnoremap dd  :<C-U>YRYankCount 'dd'<CR>
            nnoremap yw  :<C-U>YRYankCount 'yw'<CR>
            nnoremap dw  :<C-U>YRYankCount 'dw'<CR>
            nnoremap ye  :<C-U>YRYankCount 'ye'<CR>
            nnoremap de  :<C-U>YRYankCount 'de'<CR>
            nnoremap yiw :<C-U>YRYankCount 'yiw'<CR>
            nnoremap diw :<C-U>YRYankCount 'diw'<CR>
            nnoremap Y   :<C-U>YRYankCount 'Y'<CR>
            nnoremap D   :<C-U>YRYankCount 'D'<CR>
            nnoremap y$  :<C-U>YRYankCount 'y$'<CR>
            nnoremap d$  :<C-U>YRYankCount 'd$'<CR>
            nnoremap yG  :<C-U>YRYankCount 'yG'<CR>
            nnoremap dG  :<C-U>YRYankCount 'dG'<CR>
<
         Examples:
                yy - Adds the current line to the yankring.
                dd - Adds the current line to the yankring and deletes it.
               5yw - Adds 5 words to the yankring.
              "ade - Deletes the word, and puts it into both the yankring
                     and the "a register.
            10"zyy - Places 10 lines into both the yankring and the "z
                     register.

4.10 YRYankRange                                 *YRYankRange*
         This command by default is only called in visual mode.  All
         visual modes (|characterwise-visual|, |linewise-visual|,
         |blockwise-visual|) are supported.  Any visually selected text
         is added to the yankring.  You can also call this command
         directly using a range.

         Examples:
            Visual mode
            -----------
            Press v (to enter visual mode), highlight want you want, 
            press y (to yank the selected area).
            Repeat using V and Control-V.

4.11 YRDeleteRange                               *YRDeleteRange*
         This command is identical to YRYankRange, except the range is
         also deleted.


4.12 YRPaste                                     *YRPaste*
        This command will paste elements from the yankring.  By default it has
        been mapped to p and P to match Vim's native key strokes.  The text
        pasted is exactly what was yanked, including newline characters and 
        blockwise-visual mode behaviours.  It supports counts and registers.

        Examples:
            p   " Paste the current element from the yankring after the cursor
            P   " Paste the current element from the yankring before the cursor
           5p   " Paste the current element from the yankring after the cursor
                  5 times
          "ap   " Ignore the yankring and paste the contents of register "a
         5"ap   " Ignore the yankring and paste the contents of register "a
                  5 times
            See also |yankring-tutorial|.

            
4.13 YRReplace                                   *YRReplace*
        The purpose of the yankring is to gain access to previously yanked
        (or deleted) elements.  This command will replace the previously 
        paste  with a different entry from the yankring.
        By default, I choose <C-P> (P for previous) to replace the last paste
        while moving backwards through the yankring.  <C-N> (N for next)
        replaces the last paste while moving forward through the yankring. 

        Examples:
            See the |yankring-tutorial| for examples.

            
4.14 YRMapsCreate                                *YRMapsCreate*
        This public function is responsible for creating the maps which
        enable the yankring.  This function is called by the YRToggle 
        command.

            
4.15 YRMapsDelete                                *YRMapsDelete*
        This public function removes the yankring maps and disables
        the yankring.  This function is called by the YRToggle command.

            
4.16 YRSearch                                    *YRSearch*
        This command is similar to |YRGetElem|.  The command takes
        one parameter which is a regular expression.  Similar to 
        YRGetElem, it will display all items in the yankring that match
        the regular expression.  It is also interactive, and will 
        prompt you to enter which match you wish pasted.
        See also |YRSearch-example|.

5. Tutorial                                      *yankring-tutorial*

 To understand how to use the yankring, the following example should
 demonstrate the various features.

    Assume we have this buffer: >
        one
        two
        three
        four
        five
<                                                *YRShow-example*     
     Now yank (yy) each line separately starting at line 1.
     Display the contents of the yankring. >
        :YRShow  
            --- YankRing ---
            Elem  Content
            5     five^@
            4     four^@
            3     three^@
            2     two^@
            1     one^@
<    Since we yanked the text starting at line 1 and finishing at
     line 5, the most current yankring element is the last one, the
     contents of line 5.  "five^@" is displayed, the "^@" is a 
     newline character (since we issued a "yy").
                                                 *YRReplace-example*     
     Now, go to the end of the file and press p.  The resulting
     buffer appears as: >
        one
        two
        three
        four
        five
        five
<    Now press <C-P> to move backwards through the yankring, 
     this results in: >
        one
        two
        three
        four
        five
        four
<    Now press 2<C-P>.  This would be the same as pressing 
     <C-P> two times in a row.  This results in: >
        one
        two
        three
        four
        five
        two
<    Now press <C-N> to move forwards through the yankring, 
     this results in: >
        one
        two
        three
        four
        five
        three
<    Display the contents of the yankring. >
        :YRShow  
            --- YankRing ---
            Elem  Content
            3     three^@
            2     two^@
            1     one^@
            5     five^@
            4     four^@
<   Here you can see the order of the elements has changed.  It is a
    "ring" therefore, it knows where it last pasted an element from
    and that element is at the start of the ring, moving forwards 
    and backwards through the ring is relative to this position.
    
    Now lets yank some text with a key stroke that has not been 
    mapped to the yankring.  Place your cursor at the start of 
    line 4.  Press ytr, yank-to-(to the character r), which yanks
    the 'fou' letters (no newline character).  Now press p.  Here is
    the result: >
        one
        two
        three
        ffouour
        five
        three
<   This is good, even though the keys 'yto' has not been mapped
    to YRYankCount, the yankring still pasted the most recently 
    yanked text.  Since the text did not have a newline character
    the 'fou' was inserted after the 'f'.

    Now replace that previous paste with the current element from
    the yankring by pressing <C-P>.  This is the result: >
        one
        two
        three
        four
        two
        five
        three
<   The 'fou' was replaced with the previous entry in the yankring,
    which so happened to be the line 'two^@'.  Since it had a 
    newline character in it (when it was yanked) the newline is
    included when it is pasted.

                                                 *YRPush-example*     
    Assume you need to paste text from the system clipboard, and this 
    is text you will need routinely.  We can simulate this by running
    this command: >
        :let @+ = "From the clipboard\n"
        :echo @+

<   With the cursor at the start of the line with the word 'five', press p.
    We still have pasted the 'fou' which is in the default paste buffer. >
        one
        two
        three
        four
        two
        ffouive
        three
<   We have the option of getting the text from the clipboard directly
    with the following. >
        First undo the previous change - u
        Next - "+p
<   The line changes since we bypassed the yankring, and specified
    which register to get the text from: >
        four
        five
        From the clipboard
        three
<   <C-P> replaces this with since we have moved backwards in the yankring: >
        four
        five
        one
        three
<   Now add the contents of the clipboard to the yankring: >
        :YRPush '+'
<   Move the cursor to the last row 'three' and press p.  The result is: >
        four
        five
        one
        three
        From the clipboard
<   YRPush '+' adds the value of the register '+' to the yankring, but it
    also adds its contents to the default Vim paste buffer.  So pressing
    p pasted this text.  By adding a new value to the yankring we have
    repositioned it which you can see with: >
        :YRShow
            --- YankRing ---
            Elem  Content
            6     From the clipboard^@
            5     five^@
            4     four^@
            3     three^@
            2     two^@
            1     one^@
<                                                *YRClear-example*     
    Now we will clear the yankring, and begin over again.   >
        :YRClear
<   So starting with the initial buffer, issue a 'yy' on each of the 5 lines.
    If you run the YRShow command you should see the following: >
        :YRShow  
            --- YankRing ---
            Elem  Content
            5     five^@
            4     four^@
            3     three^@
            2     two^@
            1     one^@
<                                                *YRSetTop-example*     
    The next time I paste from the yankring, it will paste element 5, since
    it is at the "top" of the yankring.  You can use the YRSetTop to
    reposition the yankring.  Assume we: >
        :YRSetTop 3
        :YRShow
            --- YankRing ---
            Elem  Content
            3     three^@
            2     two^@
            1     one^@
            5     five^@
            4     four^@
<                                                *YRGetElem-example*     
    Now the next element to be pasted from the yankring with will element 3,
    the line "three\n".  There are times when you might not know the exact
    element number you want pasted into Vim, and you do not want to cycle
    through the yankring to get to it.  YRGetElem is used to specify which
    element you want to paste, without having to use <C-P> and <C-N> to find
    it: >
        :YRGetElem 
            --- YankRing ---
            Elem  Content
            3     three^@
            2     two^@
            1     one^@
            5     five^@
            4     four^@
        :Enter # to paste:
<   Without parameters YRGetElem enters interactive mode.  It uses YRShow
    to display the yankring, and prompts you to enter the element you want
    pasted.  You may want to create a separate mapping for this call.  
    See |YRGetElem| for an example.  If a parameter is supplied, YRGetElem 
    will paste the element without prompting the user. >
        :YRGetElem 1
<   Will paste this line into the buffer: >
        one
<   It does not alter what is at the top of the yankring, so if I pressed 'p'
    it would still paste element 3 next. 
                                                 *YRGetMultiple-example*     
    There are times when you need to move through a buffer capturing many
    different lines (or snippets of code) and eventually want to switch 
    buffers and paste these elements.  With some advance planning you can do 
    this without the yankring by issuing commands of the form: >
        "ayy
        "Ayy
<   When specifying the register using UPPERCASE, Vim appends the yanked text
    to register "a, instead of replacing it.  Many times you forget the
    advance planning (or didn't even know about this great feature) you can 
    use the YRGetMultiple command.  It will paste (one after the other) as
    many elements as you specify. >
        :YRGetMultiple 4
<   Will paste the following entries into the buffer: >
        three
        two
        one
        five
<   When you issue a YRShow, it just pasted the 4 top entries from the
    yankring.  YRGetMultiple with no argument will paste just the top entry
    and YRGetMultiple with a very high number will paste all the entries in
    the yankring. >
        :YRGetMultiple
            three
        :YRGetMultiple 99
            three
            two
            one
            five
            four
<   YRGetMultiple can also take a !(bang) operator, and an optional
    second parameter to indicate which position in the yankring to begin
    pasting elements. >
        :YRGetMultiple 3,2
            two
            one
            five
        :YRGetMultiple! 3,2
            five
            one
            two
<   YRGetMultiple 3,2 means, paste 3 elements from the yankring and start
    at element 2.  Looking at: >
        :YRShow
            --- YankRing ---
            Elem  Content
            5     five^@
            4     four^@
            3     three^@
            2     two^@
            1     one^@
<   So yanking 3 elements starting at element 2, means 2,1,5, since we wrapped 
    around to the top of the yankring.  Adding the !(bang) operator indicates
    to reverse the order the elements are pasted.  This is very useful if you
    move through a buffer from top to bottom yanking text.  When you paste it
    using YRGetMultiple, the elements are pasted in LIFO (Last In First Out)
    order, therefore the elements are reversed.  Using YRGetMultiple! will
    paste the elements in FIFO (First In First Out) maintaining the order of
    the original buffer (since you read and yanked from top to bottom).
    
                                                 *YRSearch-example*

<                                                *yankring-visual-example*     
    There are 3 visual modes and all are supported.  Any visually selected 
    text is added to the yankring.  You can try the various modes.  

    |characterwise-visual|
        Go to line 1, press v and move using the cursor keys until you have
        highlighted some text.  Then press y to yank the visually selected
        area.  Pressing p with paste the yanked region.
    
    |linewise-visual|
        Go to line 2, press V and move using the cursor keys until you have
        highlighted some text.  Notice the entire line is selected (including
        the carriage returns).  Then press y to yank the visually selected
        area.  Pressing p with paste the yanked region.
    
    |blockwise-visual|
        Go to line 3 column 4, press CTRL-V and move to the right using the
        cursor keys until you have highlighted some text.  Then press y to
        yank the visually selected area.  Pressing p with paste the yanked
        region.  Notice the pasted text retained its blockwise visual
        characteristics.
    
                                                 *YRYankRange-example*     
    YRYankRange is called during visual modes, but it is also possible to
    use this via the command line. >

                                                 *global-example*     
    Using Vim's |:global| command can be very useful at times.  The example
    adds all rows (in a buffer) to the yankring if they have a certain
    phrase: >
        :g/addme/YRYankCount 'yy'
<   This is the breakdown for the above command: >
        :g                  - for each line in the buffer
        /addme              - check if the string "addme" is in the line
        /YRYankCount 'yy'   - Ask the yankring to execute the 'yy' command

6. History                                       *yankring-history*

  1.6: April 20, 2005: 
         NF: YRSearch is similar to YRGetElem.  Given a regular expression
             it will interactively display all the elements in the yankring
             that match the regular expression.  You can enter the number
             of the element to paste it.  If you have many elements within
             the yankring, this can help you identify them more easily.
         NF: Updated the default history size from 30 to 100, which is 
             partially the reason for the YRSearch command.
         NF: By default it supports "gp" and "gP", in addition to "p" and "P".
         NF: Added support for the expression register (:h quote=).  Here
             is an example of how it is used:
                "="X"<CR>P
 
  1.5: March 30, 2005: 
         NF: The yankring now respects the cpoptions setting, if 'y' is
             included and you press '.', the previous yank command is executed
             and added to the yankring.  You can also add this behaviour by
             setting this in your |vimrc|: >
                let g:yankring_dot_repeat_yank = 1
<        NF: Duplicates will not be added to the yankring by default.  If
             a duplicate is found, the element will be moved to the top
             of the yankring.  This can be controlled by setting this in 
             your |vimrc|: >
                let g:yankring_ignore_duplicate = 0 (1 is default)
<        BF: Regression from version 1.4, the '.' operator may incorrectly
             insert garbage.

  1.4: March 28, 2005: 
         NF: YRToggle has been updated.  If you toggle the yankring off
             (disable) the maps it creates are removed.  Calling YRToggle
             again will recreate the maps.  This truly disables the yankring,
             where the previous version attempted to do this via code.
         BF: Using the '.' operator was not correctly replaying operations
             that did not move text in some way (g~t_) changed the case
             of the text but a '.' did not replay it.
         BF: When replacing previously pasted text the yankring did not
             respect what key was used to paste the text originally.
             All replaced items were pasted using 'p', even if you had
             originally pasted the text with 'P'.

  1.3: March 16, 2005: 
         BF: The '.' operator did not handle the <<, >> shift operator.
             Pressing '.' would result in the previous yankring operation
             instead of repeating the shift.

  1.2: March 14, 2005: 
         NF: Added support for '.' operator to repeat the last change.
         NF: Changed YRGetElem to show the contents of the yankring
             and allow you to choose which element you want pasted.
             It is only interactive if you do not provide a parameter.
         NF: Added 'ygg,dgg' default maps by extending the yankring_n_keys
             variable.

  1.1: March 09, 2005: 
         NF: Added support for the black hole register |quote_|.
         NF: Custom Maps allows the user to more finely tune the yankring
             maps to perform whatever action they require.  This function,
             YRRunAfterMaps(), is run automatically after the yankring 
             creates it's default mappings.  See |yankring-custom-maps|.
         NF: Added some more default maps by extending the yankring_n_keys
             variable.  It now contains:
                yy,dd,yw,dw,ye,de,yE,dE,yiw,diw,yaw,daw,y$,d$,Y,D,yG,dG
             NOTE:  You can easily extend these default mappings by 
             creating this global variable in your |vimrc|, you do not
             have to wait for the plugin to be updated.
         NF: Added support for Dr. Chips GetLatestVimScripts plugin.
         BF: The check for g:yankring_n_keys was incorrect, so it was not
             possible to override the default maps.

  1.0: March 08, 2005: 
         NF: Initial release.
